# Appearance

Time to Local uses one workspace with two palettes. **Appearance → Theme** selects **Dark**, **Light** or **System**. Dark is the default and reset choice; System follows device colour-scheme changes live. There is no separate design selector. The compact clock/name header leads directly into **Message**, destination controls and results; a hidden page heading supplies the accessible page name. The footer contains the privacy note.

## Layout and visual system

The approved A editorial workspace supplies the common arrangement: separate editor and results surfaces, with results slightly wider. Light maps A's warm paper/clay palette; Dark maps B's forest/lime palette and result emphasis. B's prototype input rail is adapted to the common arrangement. The header, workspace and footer share gutters. The maximum width is 1240px including 40px gutters; columns use `1fr 1.13fr` with a 28px gap at 820px and above. Below 820px they stack in reading order. Gutters shrink to 16px at 760px and 12px below 360px. Resize retains the current draft, results and preferences.

| Token          | Light     | Dark      |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Page           | `#f7f4ed` | `#0c120f` |
| Panel          | `#eee8dd` | `#141e18` |
| Field          | `#fffdf8` | `#101a14` |
| Text           | `#29251e` | `#e7eee8` |
| Secondary text | `#6d6559` | `#a1b3a5` |
| Border         | `#d4cbbd` | `#31473a` |
| Accent         | `#8e4029` | `#b2ed89` |
| Accent text    | `#ffffff` | `#10200e` |

Geist is bundled locally, with system fallback for other scripts or font-load failure. Light destination headings use a restrained system Georgia accent; both heading variants reserve common geometry so theme selection does not reflow controls. Times use tabular numerals; seconds and milliseconds stay intact, and Copy moves below long values on narrow screens. Workspace surfaces have 24px corners, the message editor 16px, single-line fields 10px, task actions 8px and Appearance a pill. Controls retain 44px targets and an immediate 2px focus outline with 3px offset. Safe areas, viewport-segment layouts and forced-colour borders remain supported. Font/licence assets participate in the offline inventory; no runtime font CDN is used.

Precise clocks keep the numeric run intact and place Copy below when their result card is at most 520px wide, including narrower desktop columns. Menus refresh horizontal placement after layout-width changes while entrance/exit feedback preserves outer positioning geometry.

## Interaction and motion

Both palettes share finite motion. Live fields, caret, triggers, outer overlays and Copy targets remain stationary during feedback. Semantic text and readable foreground/surface pairs remain fully opaque: optional reference travel/scale/whole-surface fades are adapted to decorative outline or nonanchored icon feedback. A finite 1px accent outline fades to transparent without competing with controls' immediate 2px keyboard-focus outline. Semantic content fades only while exiting after it becomes inert and hidden from the accessibility tree.

Touch task controls replace the browser tap overlay with an immediate rounded palette fill and inset ring. Copy and selected calendar dates retain their contrasting foreground/surface pair. Release, cancellation, drag, scrolling and context menus clear the touch state without intercepting native actions. Hover feedback applies on hover-capable devices; keyboard focus remains immediate, and editable fields keep native caret, selection and context menus. The native diagnostic checkbox retains its palette accent, focus and browser feedback. This feedback preserves existing control and popup geometry.

| Interaction               | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Page entrance             | Panels receive decorative outline feedback once per load over 320ms, with at most 40ms stagger. Header/editor are immediately usable. Completion or reduced-motion selection consumes the entrance; conversion, theme, resize and switching back to normal motion do not replay it.                                                                                            |
| Controls and menus        | Border/shadow feedback takes 140ms while foreground/background pairs change together immediately. Menus receive 180ms outline feedback on opening; closing content becomes noninteractive immediately and may fade over 120ms. Focus, Escape and dismissal take effect immediately.                                                                                            |
| Interpretation and format | Chevron turns over 160ms. Opening content receives 220ms outline feedback at intrinsic height, with no height interpolation. Closing content becomes inert and hidden immediately, committing intrinsic geometry before another control can be pressed; rapid reversal follows the requested state with readable opacity restored immediately.                                 |
| Results and state         | Genuinely new committed groups receive 180ms outline feedback, staggered by at most 30ms with completion within 240ms. Their feedback marker expires and is cleared by reduced-motion selection, so returning to normal motion does not replay it. Existing numeric updates are atomic. Empty/error/ambiguity text appears immediately with 180ms decorative outline feedback. |
| Copy                      | Confirmation appears only after clipboard success; reserved label width avoids jumping. Success feedback takes 160ms and returns to idle after about 1.5s. Failure keeps manual copy and accessible status available.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Theme                     | Semantic foreground/surface pairs switch together immediately to retain readable contrast. Explicit Light/Dark choices use 200ms border/shadow feedback and a finite compact clock-hand settle. First resolution, System selection and live System changes suppress existing control transitions and apply immediately. Draft, results and focus are preserved.                |

Entrance/reveal uses `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`; border/shadow feedback uses a symmetric ease. Semantic palette changes are atomic and opening/state feedback is decorative because interpolating opposite Light/Dark colours or fading whole surfaces made intermediate text unreadable. Finite outline/border/shadow/clock feedback preserves the approved interaction timing without reducing semantic contrast. Conversion is never delayed for animation. There are no perpetual decorative loops, counting time values or broad `transition: all` rules. Stale presentation work is cancelled or replaced when edits, reset or unmount supersede it.

Reduced motion is honored on first load and live preference changes. Travel, scale, stagger, clock gestures and interpolated disclosure height are removed; requested final states appear immediately and nonessential colour feedback is immediate or at most 50ms. Conversion, focus, validation and copy work identically without animation.

## Preserved state and semantics

The existing **Date format** interpretation and **Time format** display/copy labels remain. Source timezone is only a fallback when input omits a zone; reference date anchors incomplete/relative dates in the source zone. Device/today defaults stay visible when settings are closed, with a correction action that opens settings and focuses the source. Source and destination remain independent. Results and copied/accessibly named endpoints use **From/To**, keeping range association, alternative interpretations and useful assumptions.

Legacy Liquid Lens and Glass Command records retain valid preferences while dropping the obsolete design field. The versioned preference key is unchanged. Reset restores Dark/default conversion settings, clears the reference date and detailed-log opt-in, and retains the message. Input/reference date remain transient; denied storage permits session-only preference changes and conversion. Share/update handoffs and user-explicit update activation retain their existing local-only lifecycle.

The approved compact-header references establish the visual direction; their static prototype predates the production motion requirement. Production acceptance follows [testing](testing.md) and the [independent review workflow](review.md), including normal/reduced-motion interruption and keyboard/pointer journeys in both palettes at desktop/narrow widths, conversion/privacy and offline/subpath/update checks. Save recordings or before/during/after sequences and full reports in ignored `.work/<ticket-id>/`; concise exact-source evidence belongs on PRs/tickets. Browser emulation does not establish physical-device, actual screen-reader or phone-performance results.
